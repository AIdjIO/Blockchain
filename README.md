# Build Blockchain
1. Build blockchain data structure
    - ability to do proof of work.
    - mine new blocks.
    - create transactions.
    - validate the chain.
    - retrieve adress data.
2. Build blockchain API / Server
    - ability to interact with blockchain through the internet.
    - ability to use all the functionaluty built into blockchain data structure.
3. Build decentralized blockchain network
    - multiple running server acting as seperate nodes.
    - nodes interact with each other and share data.
    - new blocks or transactions created are broadcast through the entire network.
4. Build network consensus algorithm
    - ensure entire network remained synchronised.
    - ensure each network nodes has correct blockchain data.
5. Build block explorer application.
    - user friendly interface to explore the block chain.
